Project Title
Time Reservation System - Web Project

Installation
To set up this project locally, you'll need to install and configure a web server, a database server, and PHP.

Prerequisites
1. XAMPP: A free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages.
2. Git: A version control system to clone the project repository.

Step 1: Install XAMPP
1. Download XAMPP:
   Go to the XAMPP download page.
   Download the XAMPP installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. Install XAMPP:
   Run the downloaded installer.
   Once the installation is complete, start the XAMPP Control Panel.

3. Start Apache and MySQL:
   Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
   Start the Apache server by clicking the "Start" button next to Apache.
   Start the MySQL server by clicking the "Start" button next to MySQL.

Step 2: Clone the Project Repository
1. Open a terminal or command prompt:
   Navigate to the htdocs directory inside your XAMPP installation folder (usually C:\xampp\htdocs on Windows or /opt/lampp/htdocs on Linux).
   'cd /path/to/xampp/htdocs'

2. Clone the repository:
   Use Git to clone the project repository into the htdocs directory.
   'git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   'cd your-repository'

Step 3: Set Up the Database
1. Open phpMyAdmin:
   Open your web browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.

2. Create a new database:
   Click on the "New" button in the left sidebar.
  Enter a name for your database
  Select "utf8_general_ci" as the collation and click "Create".

3. Import the database schema:
   Click on the newly created database in the left sidebar.
   Go to the "Import" tab.
   Click "Choose File" and select the SQL file provided within the db folder (i.e., project.sql).
   Click "Go" to import the database schema.

Step 4: Access the Project
1. Open your web browser:
   Navigate to http://localhost/your-repository to access the project.
   Replace your-repository with the actual name of the project folder.

Project Features

Security: The information is securely stored in a MySQL database.
Error Handling: The system includes error handling to prevent unauthorized access.

2. Navigation System
User Interface: Provides a clear and intuitive interface for users to navigate through various features.

3. Timeslot Sorting Algorithm
Submission Handling: Receives users' submissions and addresses issues such as duplicate timeslot selections.
First-Come-First-Served: Assigns timeslots to students on a first-come-first-served basis.

4. Password Creation
Password Generation: Admins can generate random 8-digit character passwords for students.
HTML Table: Displays users' username and their corresponding passwords in an HTML table that can be downloaded as an Excel file.
Database Storage: Stores users' username and passwords in the MySQL database after submission.

5. Timeslot Creation
Web-based Creation: Admins can create timeslots with details such as meeting title, subject code, meeting days, and a limit on user choices per day.
Excel Input: Allows admins to input username via an Excel file for easier submission.
UUID Generation: Generates a random UUID code upon meeting/timeslot creation to distinguish different subject timeslot arrangements.

6. Preference Selection and Submission
Timeslot Selection: Users can select and submit their available timeslots through the webpage.
Choice Order: Users can choose the order of their timeslot preferences.
Database Storage: Stores the selected timeslots in the server.
Submission Confirmation: Displays a successful submission message after students submit their selections.

7. Result & Status
Meeting Status: Admins can check the status of meetings to see how many users have submitted their choices.
Results Generation: Admins can generate and check the full results of timeslot allocations.
Student Access: Users can check their choices after the results are generated by the admins.

Coding Methods
The project utilizes a combination of programming languages, web server, and database technologies to create a robust and interactive web-based system:

PHP and HTML: These open-source languages are used for server-side programming, forming the backend of the system.
JavaScript: This language is used to develop client-side functions that control webpage behavior.
jQuery: A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversal, event handling, and animation.
Node.js: An open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser, allowing for server-side scripting.

CSS: A style sheet language employed to define styles and decorative elements of the web pages.
Bootstrap: A powerful, open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.

Apache HTTP Server: This web server handles HTTP requests from users, delivering the requested information in the form of files and web pages.
MySQL: An open-source relational database management system used to store user inputs, such as student and teacher information.
